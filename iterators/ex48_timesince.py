'''
Normally, invoking a function multiple times means that the local variables are
reset with each invocation. 
However, a generator function works differently: itâ€™s only
invoked once, and thus has a single stack frame. so local variables are NOT reset

Note - this is not gnerator expression (but it looks like)
